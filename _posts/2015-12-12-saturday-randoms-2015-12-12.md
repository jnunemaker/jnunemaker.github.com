## Quotes

> The true purpose of testing, just like the true purpose of design, is to reduce costs.

Sandi Metz in Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby.

## Motivational

[Want to Create Things That Matter? Be Lazy.](http://99u.com/articles/52345/want-to-create-things-that-matter-be-lazy)<br />Love the splitting of work into two categories: deep and shallow. How often do we get caught up in shallow work. For example, often times I stay on top of my GitHub notifications, but at the end of the day I don't feel very productive. I "worked" quite a bit, responded to several things, and definitely added value, but yet have that lingering feeling that I didn't get much done.

On the contrary, the days where I forget to check my notifications, I often feel super productive. I think the reason is that on those days I am completely in the zone working on something deep.

> It’s more useful to divide this activity into two distinct types of effort, deep > and shallow:

> 1. Deep Work: Cognitively demanding tasks that require you to focus without > distraction and apply hard to replicate skills.
> 2. Shallow Work: Logistical style tasks that do not require intense focus or the > application of hard to replicate skills.

## Latency

[Page Weight Doesn't Matter](http://www.nateberkopec.com/2015/11/05/page-weight-doesnt-matter.html)<br />Great post about the fact that bandwidth is not the only issue. The other issue is N+1 requests because each request has a minimum amount of latency.

[9.5 Low Latency Decision as a Service Design Patterns](http://tech.forter.com/9-5-low-latency-decision-as-a-service-design-patterns/)<br />I particularly enjoyed the section on dynamic timeouts. Too often we add a timeout that is worst-case scenario, but really, we could detect issues earlier if we made our timeouts more dynamic based on the work being carried out.

> That timeout is a function of the minimum/maximum time for the operation to complete, and the time-to-live (remaining time) of this specific request.

## Interfaces

[Let’s talk about logging](http://dave.cheney.net/2015/11/05/lets-talk-about-logging)<br />Great post in simplifying the logging interface. Uses go as an example, but applies to any language. I've never used anything other than info and debug, so naturally I agree with Dave.

> I believe that there are only two things you should log:

> 1. Things that developers care about when they are developing or debugging > software.
> 2. Things that users care about when using your software.
>
> Obviously these are debug and info levels, respectively.

## On GitHub

[KairosDB](http://kairosdb.github.io/)<br />It wouldn't be one of my random posts without a link to a new database. I'm especially attracted to TSDB's so this caught my eye. I'm not saying I'd ever use it, but I'm always curious to kick the tires.

> Fast Time Series Database on Cassandra.

[Web Debugging Proxy based on Chrome DevTools Network panel.](https://github.com/kdzwinel/betwixt)<br />I installed and gave it a test run and it works as advertised. Pretty neat.

> This tool will help you analyze web traffic outside the browser using familiar Chrome DevTools interface.
