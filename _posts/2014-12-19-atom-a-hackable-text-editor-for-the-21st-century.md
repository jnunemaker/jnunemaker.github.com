Last night at [Local Variables](http://www.meetup.com/localvariables/events/219176565/) I presented on [Atom](http://atom.io), GitHub's relatively new text editor. I did an overview followed by a short demo. It has been a few years since I've done a talk, so it was good to get in front of people again.

I've embedded the talk below for anyone interested in flipping through the slides. If/when I get a video link, I'll include that as well.

Additionally, if you have not checked out Atom yet, what are you waiting for? I use atom full time, and although I occasionally have issues with it, it is still my favorite editor to date. Give it a go!
