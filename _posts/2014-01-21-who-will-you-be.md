title: Who will you be?

I have been thinking about this a lot lately.

## Person #1

Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start.

## Person #2

Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish.

A reminder to myself and anyone who reads this: Be person #2. **Be a finisher**.
