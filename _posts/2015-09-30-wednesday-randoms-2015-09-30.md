## Data

[Building DistributedLog: Twitter’s high-performance replicated log service](https://blog.twitter.com/2015/building-distributedlog-twitter-s-high-performance-replicated-log-service)<br />How Twitter build a distributed log on top of [Apache BookKeeper](http://bookkeeper.apache.org). Great post on the features they required and the results.

> In this section we describe DistributedLog, a serving layer that we built on top of BookKeeper to provide an end-to-end log service satisfying the requirements above.

[ScyllaDB: world's fastest NoSQL column store database](http://www.scylladb.com)<br />New beta database that claims to be drop in replacement for cassandra, but way faster. We'll see. They don't expect to be production ready [until at least January 2016](http://www.scylladb.com/technology/status/).

> Fully compatible with Apache Cassandra at 10x the throughput and jaw dropping low latency.

[Kudu - Fast analytics on fast data](http://getkudu.io)<br />Cloudera releases a new addition to the Hadoop ecosystem. Uses raft if you need a buzz word to be interested.

> Kudu provides a combination of fast inserts/updates and efficient columnar scans to enable multiple real-time analytic workloads across a single storage layer.

## Product

[Lost your vision](http://warpspire.com/posts/lost-in-your-vision/)<br />Another great post by Kyle, this time on "small gradual improvements" to existing features over new, big ideas.

> Unfortunately, this is tunnel vision and serves only to blind you from seeing the most lucrative territory: small gradual improvements to existing features and cranking out good-enough ideas. Also known as boring work.

## Natural Disasters

[The really big one](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one)<br />This article makes me worried for all my friends in SF, Portland and Seattle.

> It will look like the whole ocean, elevated, overtaking land. Nor will it be made only of water—not once it reaches the shore. It will be a five-story deluge of pickup trucks and doorframes and cinder blocks and fishing boats and utility poles and everything else that once constituted the coastal towns of the Pacific Northwest.

## Health

[Reducing workplace burnout: the relative benefits of cardiovascular and resistance exercise](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4393815/)<br />I've been far more active the past year or two of my life and I can confirm this. The more active I am the happier and more productive I am.

> After four weeks of exercise participants had greater positive well-being and personal accomplishment, and concomitantly less psychological distress, perceived stress, and emotional exhaustion.

<hr />

[An interactive self-care guide](http://philome.la/jace_harr/you-feel-like-shit-an-interactive-self-care-guide/play)<br />Kind of neat interactive guide to figuring out why you don't feel good. Guides you through food, medicine, fluids, sleep and more.

> Have you eaten in the last four hours? Have you taken any medication you need to take? Can you take a guess at how many hours you've slept out of the last 24?
